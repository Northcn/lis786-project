You need an account now to access personal online services such as banking, shopping, entertainment, and socializing.
All of those types of websites will ask for personal information such as name, address, telephone number, and email address,
credit card information, and sometimes your social security number (SSN).
This is why it's important to have strong account security, so you can protect your private information, avoid 
identity threat prevent, or unauthorized access. If your personal information were to be stolen, it can be 
a headache to deal with.
<br>
<br>
Below are ways to keep your account safe.

<br>
**1. Strong Password**:
 Strong passwords is the easiest way to make sure your account is safe. Always keep your 
passwords long (+12 characters), mix upper and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
Use different passwords for different accounts and change your password regurlarly.
*Do NOT use easily guessed information or passwords such 'password' or your first and last name*

<br>
<br>
**2. Two-Factor Authentication(2FA)/Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):** 
This adds an extra protection to your account by requiring a second type of verification other
than your password. This could be a code sent to your number or email address, or a 
biometric scan.
*You should always turn this on if you have the option because it can be the thing to stop your account from being hacked*
