Cell Phones have become very important and are used for a lot of important things such as banking, social media,
emails, contacts, photos, messages, financial data such as credit cards, and other private information.
This is why it's important to keep all your mobile devices safe from hackers.
<br>
<br>
Below are ways to keep your mobile devices safe.
<br>
<br>
**1. Use Strong Lockdown Passwords For Your Mobile Device**
Always set a strong PIN, password, or a biometric feature such as fingerprint or face recognition to lock
your mobile device. Never leave your mobile devices without some type of password because if it's stolen,
they will have free access to your information.

<br>
**2. Use Strong Passwords For Your Apps**
There are apps such as bank apps that provides you with an extra set of protection by using
a biometric feature. There are also safe apps you can download in the app store that allow you
to add passcodes to whatever app you want. This is smart to have if your mobile device is ever stolen
and the person is able to log into the phone. Certain apps may still be inaccesible to them.

<br>
<br>
**3. Always Remember Your Email/ICloud Connected to Your Device**
This is extremely important if your device is stolen, you are able to log in through another device
and wipe your mobile device. If the hacker is able to bypass your passcode, they will be met with
a wiped out device.

**4. Avoid Public WI-FI For Sensitive Activities**
Using public WIFI to access private information is risky on public WIFI because 
these networks can be vulnerable to hackers. You can be at risk of 
Man-in-the-Middle attacks (MitM), stolen login credentials, and banking data.

<br>
**5. Back up Your Data Consistently**
Protect your data from being lost by regularly backing it up on a safe storage. If your mobile device
is ever stolen and lost, you can recover your important information.
