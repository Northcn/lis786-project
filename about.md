This is my page about cyberthreats and what they each mean

*From Cisco:* Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems, networks, and programs from digital attacks. 
These cyberattacks are usually aimed at accessing, changing, or destroying sensitive information; 
extorting money from users through ransomware; or interrupting normal business processes.

 CyberSecurity Threats that can compromise emails, passwords, and social media accounts


- **Phishing**<br>
    A cyberattack that pretends to be a trustworthy source sending you emails, messages, or website links. 
    When you click it, it steals your personal information such as login information or credit card information.
<br>
<br>
- **Malware**<br>
    Program inserted into a system with the intent of compromising the information of the victims.
<br>
<br>
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks**<br>
    A cyberattack that intercepts communication between two parties. It allows the hacker to eavesdrop
    on private conversations or steal data.
<br>
<br>
- **Brute Force Attacks**<br>
    Brute Force Attacks is essentially a guessing game. A hacker will try multiple logins until
    they get the correct one. 
<br>
<br>
- **Social Engineering**<br>
    Manipulating or threatening someone into revealing private information. It's more about
    manipulating someone than a technical threat.
<br>
<br>
- **Credential Stuffing**<br>
    A type of cyberattack in which your login information is stolen from a data breach and used
    to attempt to log into another site because many people use the same login information for 
    multiple websites.
<br>
<br>
- **SIM Swapping**<br>
    When hackers gain access to someone's phone number which allows them to access personal information.
    This happens when the hacker convinces a mobile carrier to transfer the individual's phone number to 
    to the hacker's SIM card, giving them access to everyone on your mobile device. 
<br>
<br>
- **QR Code Scams**<br>
    QR Code Scams are being increasingly more common because of the higher use of QR codes now.For example, 
    many restaurants have started to use QR codes to display their menu. There are now malicious QR codes that 
    lead to fake websites and steal your information.
<br>
<br>
- **Data Breaches**<br>
    When the company's website is hacked into by someone not authorized and gains access to important data.
    Data breaches alot of times are unavoidable. There have been multiple data breaches with popular websites such as
    Equifax, Facebook, and Paypal. Many times your information is released to the Dark Web, so it's important to add MFA
    and change your password right after a data breach to possibly save your account from being hacked into.
